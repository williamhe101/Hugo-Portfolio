## Overview

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Over the 2021-2022 school year, I interned with Murata Electronics on multiple different projects with their radio frequency (RF) team. I have been working in person at their Dallas office (Carrollton specifically) and had a great time!



**Pre-Internship/Employment**
I wanted to put this section here since I want any readers to know what experience I had at the time, possibly inspiring them to go forth on their own career search.
At the time of the interview, I only had a service industry job (for 2 months so far) as well as a few leadership positions under my belt. I had one project from my school work, which was a big emphasis on my interview as I did a lot of the hardware for it, which relates to this hardware internship. I also talked about my experience as an IEEE Committee Leader for our first and second annual Comet Hack (Hackathon) as an Events and Logistics Committee lead. I did not have any previous internship experience so this was my first time ever, as well as first job that relates to my engineering major.
