## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

â €â €â €Over the 2021-2022 school year, I interned with Murata Electronics on multiple different projects with their radio frequency (RF) team. I have been working in person at their Dallas office (Carrollton specifically) and had a great time!

## Pre-Internship/Employment
â €â €â €I wanted to put this section here since I want any readers to know what experience I had at the time, possibly inspiring them to go forth on their career search.
At the time of the interview, I only had a service industry job (for 2 months so far) as well as a few leadership positions under my belt. I had one project from my school work, which was a big emphasis on my interview as I did a lot of the hardware for it, which relates to this hardware internship. I also talked about my experience as an IEEE Committee Leader for our first and second annual Comet Hack (Hackathon) as an Events and Logistics Committee lead. I did not have any previous internship experience so this was my first time, as well as the first job that relates to my engineering major.

## Equipment
â €â €â €Murata was very generous with the equipment that I could use for work. Although it did take a while to get everything set up, eventually my inventory included:
â€£ a very powerful HP ZBook Fury 17 G7 Workstation
â€£ Logitech mouse and keyboard combo
â€£ headset
â€£ a Dell monitor
â€£ docking station
And if you were lucky, you could get other goodies if they had merch for March for Murata, an annual event that gave Murata exposure to their services and products (with free swag too of course). 

## Overall Experience
â €â €â €Murata Electronics was my first ever internship, so I was not sure what to expect. Apparently, I was the first-ever intern that they had, or at least in the Murata office, so there was not an established "intern program" per se, but it gave me a different experience than other companies since it allowed me to work amongst the entire engineering team. I did experience imposter syndrome as I felt that I did not know much or if anything coming in for the field of RF, but I was assigned a mentor, an experienced engineer named Michael.

â €â €â €Now my words alone would not do him enough justice but Michael has truly transformed my experience at Murata. Michael and I closely work together as I work indirectly under him but I shadow much of his work and learn by having hands-on experience by following him and his work. His talent is that he makes work fun and lightens up the mood! I can say that my sole experience lies from learning from him as he helped me tremendously by answering all my questions but also taking the time to help me with what I bet he considers simple tasks in the engineering field. It was very comforting to have a mentor like Michael, and I wouldn't give the experience for anything else.

â €â €â €Over time, I started gaining confidence within myself to pursue what I wanted to learn, as well as freely expressing my opinions/questions throughout the entire internship. My manager, Mark, as well as the other engineers (not limited to the hardware section) was extremely friendly and treated me as an equal, never condescending and always helpful, willing to help. I would say that it made my time more comfortable, as we would go out to lunch together and have a good laugh, or just talk like normal people, discussing sports or events during our downtime. With this warm environment, I was able to gain that self-confidence and even lead a significant amount of responsibilities on multiple projects where I built circuits, collected results, proved analysis, created presentations, etc. Although initially hesitant, it allowed for me to step up to a role I would say, ABOVE interning, as I felt like a true, part-time employee because of the functions and projects I was a part of. 

â €â €â €Eventually, I even pitched my project, as you might have seen on my home page, the Magic Mirror project. The idea was well-received by Murata management and I was fully sponsored to create this idea, as it has been on my mind for over 4 years at the time of writing it. The task was to make a fully functional, customizable display that had WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, as well as Murata components, all within a mirror that is seemingly inconspicuous, but with a semi-futuristic twist once you turn it on and deliver a prototype to be hung up at Murata's Dallas Office (This is still in the works as I want to personalize it a bit more).

â €â €â €Although, there is still plenty to learn from the RF field, as it is considered the **BLACK BOX** of engineering haha.

## Work Experience
â €â €â €Since I do not have other engineering experiences to compare it to, I would say that Murata is quite balanced. There were times where it was hustlin' and bustlin' and then times where it was very chill. This was dependent on me as well since if I wanted to involve myself in other projects, it was as simple as asking my manager or an engineer about the project. Everyone was very receptive and kind to let you take part or just be involved in general. 

â €â €â €I cannot go into detail about everything but there was definitely a lot to learn and even more to be learned, and it felt overwhelming because of the sheer unit that is the RF field. I did have multiple successful projects while interning here, with me being one of the main participants in working on projects where my results were very important. 

â €â €â €My manager, Mark, was very kind too, as he would stop by at the beginning of every week in the morning to ask how my weekend was. Work hours were very flexible as well, Mark was very understanding if I had duties outside of internship like an upcoming exam, if I had to attend a review for a class, etc. He and I worked out a fixed schedule around my school work and he always prioritized my well-being first, school second, and then internship, which was amazing and very understanding. I worked two different semesters with two different schedules because of my school times, but in my first semester, I worked 9-5 on Tuesdays, and Thursdays, and got off earlier on Friday to attend my EE lab. During my second semester in the Spring, I worked 9-5 Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, but to reiterate what I said earlier, my schedule was flexible around the school. 

## Networking and Culture
â €â €â €Murata Electronics as a company from the start was a very dedicated and hard-working company, which shows in their success as they are in quite literally almost every technological and electrical product to date. If I had a question, either Michael or the person who he points me toward could answer it. This, I would assume, is special about Murata. I could walk down the hall and talk to someone in IT or the sales engineers if I wanted to, and everyone would be very kind and helpful, just an overall welcoming environment. I don't want it to seem like propaganda but this is an unfiltered opinion of mine, but truly the people who work here get their job done but also make it feel cozy and friendly.

## MISC
â €â €â €I had downtime throughout my internship which allowed me to de-stress and relax from whatever was happening during the day to just do something that I wanted to do, which would be supported by my co-workers. I remember Qualcomm had a few courses on 5G and I simply asked my manager if I had free time, could I try and finish these certificates and he even pushed me towards the idea, as he wants me to grow and learn. I kept a journal throughout my internship, albeit sometimes I got lazy on writing what I learned and did during the day with shorter sentences, but even just having the luxury to stop and wind down and record what happened today is something that I appreciate. 

â €â €â €Aside from my passion project for the Magic Mirror, another favorite of mine was the NFC PCB boards. It started probably a month into my internship when Michael gave me a simple board from Nordic Semiconductors, where I saw this golden coil on a flimsy flap that connected to the board that could churn your phone to a website! Now admittedly, this impressed me and interested me so much that I started researching about NFCs, in which I got blessed to work on another NFC project with real PCB boards and got to manually test and configure them! It was as if my internship came into a full loop of NFCs haha!

## Final Thoughts
â €â €â €Whether I am returning or not, I'm super grateful for this awesome and memorable internship over my Junior year of university. I got to work with this phenomenal team on multiple products that piqued my interest in RF and learned a ton. My 


â €â €â €Special thanks to Michael Feng, my mentor, and Mark Fan, my manager, for leading me down this life-changing experience at Murata Electronics and I seriously cannot thank you guys enough.
